To install, copy the contents of plugin to your user-specific vim plugin
directory, probably ~/.vim/plugin/.

To install documentation, copy README to your vim documentations directory,
probably ~/.vim/doc/.  After copying the documentation, execute ":helptags
~/.vim/doc" from within vim to make the documentation accessible.

	rake install

accomplishes all of this for you.


Once VLH is installed, make sure to edit your ~/.vimrc to include

	let g:vlh_repository_dir = "/path/where/youd/like/to/store/localhistory"

I suggest using /home/$USER/.vim/localhistory
