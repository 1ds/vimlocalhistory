About
------
Automatically saves files on write using git.  This provides a convenient,
automatic backup system of, e.g. files in /etc that are modified, as well as a
poor man's "local history" (a l√° the eclipse feature with the same name).


Commands
--------

History
	diff a specific item
	open a specific item
	restore a specific item
		i.e., open to the current buffer and write


Configuration
-------------
g:vlh_respository_dir
g:vlh_exclude_file_pattern
g:vlh_exclude_path_pattern

These can't be changed dynamically
----------------------------------
g:vlh_log_dir


TODO
=====
Fix vimlocalhistory.vim
	it tests for files relative Dir.pwd, but really it should try to find itself
	in the runtimepath and load files relative to that

	$: should now include the directory containing vimlocalhistory.vim
	It seems to be loading VimLocalHistory, but not saving on writes -- must
	investigate

Implement File history buffer
Finish file history buffer (diff item / open item / restore item)
Make the history buffer prettier (Let git colour it or have syntax highlighting)

Implement scp://*

Write a vim help file
Cleanup this Readme

Deal with project-todo and project-fixme

Post to vim./mailing list
Maybe package for debian
	http://pkg-vim.alioth.debian.org/vim-policy.txt


Long Term (maybe features)
--------------------------
edit history message feature
cleanup disk space feature
delete commit feature
