Automatically saves files on write using git.  This provides a convenient,
automatic backup system of, e.g. files in /etc that are modified, as well as a
poor man's "local history" (a l√° the eclipse feature with the same name).


Behaviours
==========

Vim Local History (VLH)
	Should be enabled if the property g:vlh_repository_dir is set


	When writing a buffer, should give a warning if VLH is enabled, but
	g:vlh_repository_dir specifies a path that does not exist, or to which the
	user doesn't have write permissions

	When writing a buffer, should initialize the git repository if VLH is
	enabled and no git repository exists at g:vlh_repository_dir and the path
	specified by g:vlh_repository_dir exists

	When writing a buffer, should commit the current buffer to the git
	repository if VLH is enabled and a git repository is initialized at
	g:vlh_repository_dir


	When committing a buffer for a local file (i.e., not an scp'd or ftp'd
	file), should do so at a pseudo-absolute path, rooted at
	g:vlh_repository_dir/localhost

	When committing a buffer for a local symlink, should strip '.' and '..' from
	the path, but should not resolve the link (so that /foo/bar and /foo/baz are
	saved separately, even if one is a symlink to the other).


	When committing a non-local buffer (e.g., an ftp'd or scp'd file), give a
	warning that this is not supported.


Command History
	
	Should give a warning if VLH is not enabled

	Should use the file history buffer if it exists

	Should use the window with the file history buffer if it exists

	Should create a new buffer for file history if no such buffer exists

	Should create a new window for file history if no such window exists.  This
	window should have the file history buffer open

	Should update the file history buffer with the output of the default log
	command


File History Buffer

	Should be read only


Commands
--------

History
	diff a specific item
	open a specific item
	restore a specific item
		i.e., open to the current buffer and write


Configuration
-------------
g:vlh_respository_dir
g:vlh_exclude_pattern
g:vlh_log_command


TODO
=====
Implement exclude patterns
hand it off to earl

Implement File history buffer
Finish file history buffer (diff item / open item / restore item)
Make the history buffer prettier (Let git colour it or have syntax highlighting)

Implement scp://*

Write a vim help file
Cleanup this Readme

Deal with project-todo and project-fixme

Long Term (maybe features)
--------------------------
edit history message feature
cleanup disk space feature
delete commit feature
